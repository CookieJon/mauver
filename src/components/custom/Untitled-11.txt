Sure, thanks - I've annotated a simplified example. Hopefully it'll explain my problem...
    
    <!-- custom control's value is computed imageData -->
    <custom-canvas-control :value='pipelineFiltered' />

    // component
    data: () { return {
        project: {  
            // Looks like...
            // filters: [{type, options, output, stuff...}, filter, filter... ]
            // srcBitmap: {pixels, palette, stuff...}
        }
    }},
    computed: {
        pipelineFiltered () {

            // start with an image (custom object)
            let bitmap = srcBitmap

            // iterate filters, change image by filter types & options
            // ## 1 ### (Need only start at the filter that changed. How??)
            this.value.filters.forEach((filter, i) => {

                  if (filter.type == 'applyPattern') {
            
                      filter.mappedBitmap = filter.options.remapPalette
                          ? utils.remapBitmapPalette(bitmap) 
                          : clone(bitmap)
                         (###2### ^ if the "remapPalette" option didn't change, don't need to call the expensive 'remapBitmapPalette()'. How to tell??)

                      filter.transformedBitmap = filter.options.transform  
                          ? utils.transformBitmap(filter.mappedBitmap , filter.x, filter.y, filter.w, filter.h)
                          : clone(filter.mappedBitmap )
 (###2b### ^ If transform, x, y, w, or height didn't change, the tx doesn't need recalculating)

                      // other options, finally...
                      bitmap = clone(filter.finalBitmap)
                      
                  }
                  // other filter types...
                }
            return utils.getImageData(bitmap)
        }
    
It seems to me that Vue must "know" somewhere what caused it to re-calculate the computed property.  I thought it would be simpler to get that information from Vue rather than write structures of my own to watch for fine-grained changes, or compare old and new data.

I've gone down this path of computed property, but I'm not wedded to it. I raised [this original question](https://forum.vuejs.org/t/dynamic-chain-of-reactive-properties-how-to/29216?u=cookiejon) when I couldn't think of how to make a dynaic chain of filter reactive at all, but I've realised it didn't quite answer the question 100% as the WHOLE chain is calculated every time.

Is there a better way altogether?
